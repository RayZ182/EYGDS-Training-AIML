    "content": "The exact limits for Gemini 1.5 Flash (formerly Gemini 2.0 Flash) using a free API key can be a little tricky to pin down precisely and are subject to change by Google. Here's what I can tell you based on available information and common practices for free API access:\n\n*   **Google AI Studio:** The primary way to access Gemini models (including 1.5 Flash) with a free API key is through Google AI Studio. Using AI Studio, you get a certain amount of free usage.\n\n*   **Free Tier Limits:** Free API access typically comes with significant restrictions to prevent abuse and encourage paid upgrades for serious usage.\n    *   **Requests Per Minute (RPM):** The most common restriction is on the number of requests you can make per minute. This is likely a low number (e.g., single-digit RPM) on the free tier.\n    *   **Tokens Per Minute (TPM):** There is also a token limit to prevent excessive output or long inputs.\n    *   **Total Usage Limits:** You will also hit limits on the total amount of usage within a day or month. Once you hit these limits you will need to upgrade to a paid plan.\n\n*   **Check the Google AI Studio Documentation:** The *most reliable* way to find the current, specific limits for the free tier is to consult the official Google AI Studio documentation and the terms of service for the Gemini API. The free limits are not always prominently displayed, but they should be somewhere in the documentation. Look for sections on pricing, quotas, or usage limits.\n\n**Key things to remember:**\n\n*   **Google Changes Limits:** Google can change these limits at any time.\n*   **Monitor Your Usage:** Pay attention to any error messages or warnings you receive when using the API. These often indicate that you're approaching or have exceeded your limits.\n*   **Paid Plan:** If you need more than the free tier provides, you'll need to switch to a paid plan.\n*   **Abuse Prevention:** Google monitors usage to prevent abuse and may suspend access if they detect violations of the terms of service.\n"
